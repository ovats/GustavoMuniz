<h1 align='center'> Hi! :wave:</h1>

I'm Gustavo!

I've started with Scala in December 2018.
In the beginning it was really tough. I remember this conversation:

- Have you ever programmed in Java?
- Yes!
- Cool! Then Scala will be easy for you !

Then I start reading the "red book" by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason ... oh my god! ... what? ... who said it is similar to Java?
So I started learning Scala taking courses in Udemy and eLearning (LinkedIn).
Almost at the same time I started learning about Akka. First it was "Akka Essentials" and then I enjoyed others like "Akka Http", "Akka Streams", "Akka Serialization", "Akka Persistence" and "Akka Remoting and Clustering". These are all amazing course from Daniel Ciocîrlan (from Rock The JVM website).

My journey includes also learning Apache Kafka, in particular I like courses from Stephane Maarek, awesome teacher!

What can you find in this repository?

I always to try new libraries, frameworks, plugins, languages, etc.
Everytime I try something new I try to upload it here.
You will find projects related to:

- Play Framework
- Akka Http
- Akka Streams
- Apache Kafka, Avro
- libraries like Pureconfig, Tapir, Scopt and others
- Docker

Learning plan for 2022:

- learn Scala 3
- learn Elixir
- learn Solidity
- learn Node.js
- learn Pyhton

But that's not all! I'm very interested in Big Data and Data Science, I wish I could have more time for learning!

I love to help people, just send me a message!
