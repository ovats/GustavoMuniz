I'm Gustavo!

I've started with Scala in December 2018.
In the beginning it was really tough. I remember this conversation:

- Have you ever programmed in Java?
- Yes!
- Cool! Then Scala will be easy for you !

Then I start reading the "red book" by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason ... oh my god! ... what? ... who said it is similar to Java?
So I started learning Scala taking courses in Udemy and eLearning (LinkedIn).
Almost at the same time I started learning about Akka. First it was "Akka Essentials" and then I enjoyed others like "Akka Http", "Akka Streams", "Akka Serialization", "Akka Persistence" and "Akka Remoting and Clustering". These are all amazing course from Daniel Ciocîrlan (from Rock The JVM website).

My journey includes also learning Apache Kafka, in particular I like courses from Stephane Maarek, awesome teacher!

I love to help people, send me a message!
