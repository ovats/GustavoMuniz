I'm Gustavo!

I've started with Scala in December 2018.
In the beginning it was really tough. I remember this conversation:

- Have you ever programmed in Java?
- Yes!
- Cool! Then Scala will be easy for you !

Then I start reading the "red book" by Paul Chiusano and R√∫nar Bjarnason ... oh my god! ... what? ... who said it is similar to Java?
So I started learning Scala taking courses in Udemy and eLearning (LinkedIn).
Almost at the same time I started learning about Akka. First it was "Akka Essentials" and then I enjoyed others like "Akka Http", "Akka Streams", "Akka Serialization", "Akka Persistence" and "Akka Remoting and Clustering". These are all amazing course from Daniel Cioc√Ærlan (from Rock The JVM website).

My journey includes also learning Apache Kafka, in particular I like courses from Stephane Maarek, awesome teacher!

üëâ What can you find in this repository?

I always to try new libraries, frameworks, plugins, languages, etc.
Everytime I try something new I try to upload it here.
You will find projects related to:

- Play Framework
- Akka Http
- Akka Streams
- Apache Kafka, Avro
- libraries like Pureconfig, Tapir, Scopt and others
- Docker

‚ô•Ô∏è Learning plan for 2022:

- learn Scala 3
- learn Elixir
- learn Solidity
- learn Node.js
- learn Pyhton

But that's not all! I'm very interested in Big Data and Data Science, I wish I could have more time for learning!
